# EliteShell DOS!

ElieteShell DOS (based on [EliteShell](https://www.reddit.com/r/eliteshell)) is a cool theme based on the theme based on the theme used by [/r/nameaserver](https://www.reddit.com/r/nameaserver). It's an awesome, minimal, easy to use, customisable, and generally really cool looking theme for your subreddit with a large focus on text. While it's is made primarily for subreddits involving computers, it can be used just about anywhere you want a DOS-ier look.

If you're using EliteShell DOS in your subreddit, please [make a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/eliteshell/submit?title=/r/YourSub%20is%20using%20EliteShell%20DOS!) and tell the original author about it! He loves to see how EliteShell is being used.
